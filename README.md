## Description

This is a website for my incredibly talented sister, Sophia, who is a hairstylist in Houston, Texas. I am attempting to re-create her existing site with improvements to the design, navigation and overall user experience.

Technologies include HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, Tailwind, Node, Redux, MongoDB and GraphQL.
